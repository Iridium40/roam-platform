  - Quick Sign-Up Flow
- API endpoint example (optional)

## Next Steps to Implement

### Step 1: Run Database Migration (5 minutes)
```bash
# In Supabase SQL Editor or psql
\i add_provider_policy_agreement.sql
```

### Step 2: Integrate into Phase 1 Onboarding (30 minutes)
Follow `PHASE1_POLICY_INTEGRATION_EXAMPLE.tsx` to:
1. Add "policy" to step types
2. Add policy to steps array  
3. Import ProviderPolicyAgreement component
4. Add handlers (handlePolicyAccept, handlePolicyDecline)
5. Add render section for policy step

### Step 3: Integrate into Staff Onboarding (20 minutes)
Same pattern as Phase 1 - add as first step before personal info

### Step 4: Test (30 minutes)
- [ ] Mobile viewport (375px width)
- [ ] Scroll tracking works
- [ ] All checkboxes required
- [ ] Download works
- [ ] Database records acceptance
- [ ] Onboarding proceeds correctly

### Step 5: Deploy (10 minutes)
```bash
git pull origin main  # Already pushed!
# Build and deploy via your normal process
```

## Total Implementation Time: ~2 hours
