# My Bookings Page - Debug Deployment Complete

## ‚úÖ Changes Deployed

I've added comprehensive debug logging to the my-bookings page to help diagnose why you're not seeing real data. The changes have been committed and pushed, and Vercel is automatically deploying them.

## üîç What I Did

### 1. **Added Enhanced Debug Logging**

Added detailed console logs to track:
- **Authentication state**: Whether you're logged in, which customer ID, email, etc.
- **Query execution**: What customer_id is being used to fetch bookings
- **Query results**: How many bookings were found, what the data looks like
- **Errors**: Any errors during the fetch process

### 2. **Debug Output Location**

Open your browser console (F12 ‚Üí Console tab) when visiting https://roamservices.app/my-bookings

You'll see messages like:
```
üîê MY BOOKINGS PAGE DEBUG: {
  is_authenticated: true/false,
  customer_id: "...",
  customer_email: "...",
  ...
}

üîç MY BOOKINGS DEBUG: Fetching bookings for user: {...}

üìä MY BOOKINGS DEBUG: Simple query result: {...}

‚úÖ MY BOOKINGS DEBUG: Successfully transformed bookings: {...}
```

## üìã Next Steps - What You Need To Do

### Step 1: Wait for Deployment
Wait about 2-3 minutes for Vercel to deploy the changes.

### Step 2: Open the My Bookings Page
1. Go to https://roamservices.app/my-bookings
2. Open browser console (press F12, then click "Console" tab)

### Step 3: Check the Debug Output
Look for the debug messages and send me:
1. Screenshot of the console output
2. Or copy/paste the console messages

### Step 4: Verify Your Login Status
In the console, run:
```javascript
JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('roam_customer'))
```

This will show you:
- If you're logged in
- Which customer account you're using
- Your customer ID

## üí° Expected Outcomes

### If you see "No currentUser"
- **Cause**: You're not logged in
- **Solution**: Log in first, then visit the my-bookings page

### If you see "No bookings found for customer_id: xxx"
- **Cause**: Your account has no bookings
- **Solution**: Either:
  1. Create a booking through the booking flow, OR
  2. Log in as a customer with existing bookings:
     - `alan@roamyourbestlife.com` (has 3 confirmed bookings)
     - `alan@smithhealthwellness.com` (has 1 completed booking)

### If you see bookings data
- **Great!** The page is working, you just needed bookings for your account

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Info

Current customers with bookings:

| Email | Bookings Count | Status |
|-------|----------------|--------|
| alan@roamyourbestlife.com | 3 | confirmed/paid |
| alan@smithhealthwellness.com | 1 | completed |
| (other customer IDs) | 6 | various pending |

## üö® Security Issue Found & Fix Recommended

I found that the `bookings` table has an RLS policy "Allow anon read access" that lets anyone read all bookings. This should be removed:

```sql
DROP POLICY "Allow anon read access" ON bookings;
```

This policy makes all bookings publicly readable, which is a security/privacy concern.

## üìû Waiting for Your Feedback

Once the deployment completes (2-3 minutes), please:
1. Visit https://roamservices.app/my-bookings
2. Open the browser console (F12)
3. Send me the console output or a screenshot

The debug logs will tell us exactly what's happening!
