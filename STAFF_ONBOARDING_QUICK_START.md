## 🔑 Key Features

---

## 🐛 Known Issues / Future Enhancements

### Recommended Enhancements
1. **Bookings Filtering**: Filter by `provider_id` for providers (only show assigned bookings)
2. **API Authorization**: Apply `roleAuth` middleware to all protected endpoints
3. **Read-Only Enforcement**: Disable edit buttons in Services/Staff tabs for non-owners
4. **Certification Management**: Add certifications/licenses for providers
5. **Service Requests**: Allow providers to request new services

### Current Limitations
1. Providers can only see configured services (no request workflow)
2. Availability stored but not yet used for scheduling
3. No certification validation
4. API endpoints need full role-based protection
