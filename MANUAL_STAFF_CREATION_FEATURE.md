- System sends invitation email with onboarding link
- Staff member completes multi-step onboarding
- Account activated after onboarding completion

### 2. **Manual Creation** (NEW!)
- Owner fills in complete staff member information
- System creates account immediately with temporary password
- Staff member can log in right away
