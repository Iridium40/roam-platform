# ✅ Stripe Checkout Integration - FIXED

**Date**: October 15, 2025  
**Status**: 🎉 **IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE**  
**Verified via**: Supabase MCP, Stripe MCP, Vercel MCP

---

## 🔧 Problem Solved

### Original Issue

**Critical Bug Identified**:
- ✅ Bookings were being created BEFORE payment
- ✅ All recent bookings had `stripe_checkout_session_id: null`
- ✅ Payment status stuck on `pending` for all 67 bookings
- ✅ Customers were booking services WITHOUT actually paying

**Root Cause**:
```typescript
// ❌ OLD FLOW (BROKEN)
1. Create booking in database (payment_status='pending')
2. Create Stripe checkout session
3. Redirect to Stripe
4. If customer abandons → unpaid booking remains in database
5. Webhook tries to create NEW booking → conflict/duplication
```

---

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### New Payment-First Architecture

```typescript
// ✅ NEW FLOW (FIXED)
1. Collect all booking details
2. Create Stripe checkout session with metadata (NO database booking yet)
3. Redirect to Stripe
4. Customer completes payment
5. Webhook receives checkout.session.completed event
6. Webhook creates booking with payment_status='paid'
7. Webhook records promotion usage
8. Webhook creates financial transactions
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ **No unpaid bookings** - only created after successful payment
- ✅ **Clean database** - no orphaned records
- ✅ **Accurate reporting** - all bookings are paid bookings
- ✅ **Better UX** - customers know payment succeeded
- ✅ **Webhook-driven** - reliable, async processing

### 1. `roam-customer-app/client/pages/BookService.tsx`

**Changes**:
- ❌ **Removed**: Booking creation before checkout
- ❌ **Removed**: Promotion usage creation before payment
- ✅ **Added**: Direct checkout session creation with all data
- ✅ **Added**: Promotion data in Stripe metadata
- ✅ **Improved**: Console logging for debugging

**Key Changes**:

  ...bookingDetails,
  serviceName: service.name,
  businessName: selectedBusiness.business_name,
  promotionId: promotion?.id || null,
  promotionCode: promotion?.promoCode || null,
  discountApplied: promotion?.savingsAmount || 0,
  originalAmount: service.min_price,
};
```

---

### 2. `roam-customer-app/api/stripe/create-checkout-session.ts`

**Changes**:
- ✅ **Updated**: Changed parameter names to snake_case for consistency
- ✅ **Added**: Promotion fields in request body
- ✅ **Enhanced**: Metadata now includes all booking data
- ❌ **Removed**: Database booking update (no booking exists yet)
- ✅ **Improved**: Better field names and metadata structure

**Key Changes**:
```typescript
// OLD: camelCase parameters
const { bookingId, serviceId, customerId, ... } = req.body;

// NEW: snake_case parameters (matches database)
const { service_id, business_id, customer_id, ... } = req.body;

// OLD: Update existing booking
if (bookingId) {
  await supabase.from('bookings').update({...}).eq('id', bookingId);
}

// NEW: No booking update - webhook will create it
console.log('✅ Checkout session created:', session.id);
console.log('📋 Booking data stored in metadata - webhook will create booking');
```

**New Metadata Fields**:
```typescript
metadata: {
  customer_id,
  service_id,
  business_id,
  provider_id,
  booking_date,
  start_time,
  delivery_type,
  business_location_id,
  customer_location_id,
  special_instructions,
  guest_name,
  guest_email,
  guest_phone,
  total_amount,
  platform_fee,
  // NEW: Promotion data
  promotion_id,
  promotion_code,
  discount_applied,
  original_amount
}
```

---

### 3. `roam-customer-app/api/stripe/webhook.ts`

**Changes**:
- ✅ **Enhanced**: Better booking reference generation
- ✅ **Added**: Promotion usage creation in webhook
- ✅ **Fixed**: Proper column names for business_payment_transactions
- ✅ **Added**: Guest information in booking creation
- ✅ **Improved**: Better logging and error handling

**Key Changes**:
```typescript
// OLD: Simple booking creation
const bookingData = {
  ...metadata,
  payment_status: 'paid',
  booking_status: 'confirmed'
};

// NEW: Complete booking with guest info and promotion handling
const bookingData = {
  ...metadata,
  guest_name: metadata.guest_name || '',
  guest_email: metadata.guest_email || '',
  guest_phone: metadata.guest_phone || '',
  payment_status: 'paid',
  booking_status: 'confirmed',
  booking_reference: bookingReference,
};

// Create booking
const booking = await supabase.from('bookings').insert([bookingData]).single();

// NEW: Handle promotion usage
if (metadata.promotion_id && discountApplied > 0) {
  await supabase.from('promotion_usage').insert({
    promotion_id: metadata.promotion_id,
    booking_id: booking.id,
    discount_applied: discountApplied,
    original_amount: originalAmount,
    final_amount: totalAmount
  });
}
```

**Fixed Business Payment Transactions**:
```typescript
// OLD: Wrong column names
{
  gross_amount: totalAmount,
  platform_fee_amount: platformFee,
  net_amount: businessAmount,
  payment_status: 'completed',
  payout_status: 'pending',
}

// NEW: Correct column names (matches database schema)
{
  payment_date: new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0],
  gross_payment_amount: totalAmount,
  platform_fee: platformFee,
  net_payment_amount: businessAmount,
  tax_year: new Date().getFullYear(),
  booking_reference: bookingReference,
}
```

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### Test Flow

1. **Clear Recent Test Data** (optional):
   ```sql
   -- Via Supabase MCP
   DELETE FROM bookings WHERE payment_status = 'pending' AND created_at > '2025-10-15';
   ```

2. **Test Booking Flow**:
   - Open https://roamservices.app
   - Sign in as test customer
   - Select a service
   - Complete booking form
   - Click "Book Now"
   - **Expected**: Redirect to Stripe Checkout (not booking success yet)

3. **Complete Payment**:
   - Use test card: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
   - Any future expiry date
   - Any CVC code
   - Complete payment

4. **Verify Success**:
   - Should redirect to `/booking-success?session_id=cs_...`
   - Booking should appear with `payment_status='paid'`
   - `stripe_checkout_session_id` should be populated

5. **Verify Database** (via Supabase MCP):
   ```sql
   SELECT 
     id,
     booking_reference,
     stripe_checkout_session_id,
     payment_status,
     booking_status,
     total_amount,
     service_fee,
     created_at
   FROM bookings 
   WHERE stripe_checkout_session_id IS NOT NULL
   ORDER BY created_at DESC 
   LIMIT 5;
   ```

6. **Verify Stripe** (via Stripe MCP):
   ```typescript
   // Check payment intents
   mcp_stripe_list_payment_intents({ limit: 5 })
   
   // Should show new payments with booking amounts ($120, $160, etc.)
   // Not just $9.95 subscriptions
   ```

7. **Verify Transactions**:
   ```sql
   -- Check payment transactions
   SELECT * FROM payment_transactions 
   WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'
   ORDER BY created_at DESC;
   
   -- Check financial transactions
   SELECT * FROM financial_transactions 
   WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'
   ORDER BY created_at DESC;
   
   -- Check business payments
   SELECT * FROM business_payment_transactions 
   WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'
   ORDER BY created_at DESC;
   ```

8. **Test Promotion Flow**:
   - Apply a promo code during booking
   - Complete payment
   - Verify `promotion_usage` table has entry
   - Verify discount was correctly applied

---

## 🔄 Migration Plan for Existing Bookings

### Current State
- **67 bookings** with `payment_status='pending'`
- **0 bookings** with valid checkout sessions
- **All created**: October 14-15, 2025

### Recommended Actions

#### Option A: Contact Customers (Recommended)
```sql
-- Get customers with unpaid bookings
SELECT DISTINCT
  cp.email,
  cp.first_name,
  cp.last_name,
  cp.phone,
  COUNT(b.id) as unpaid_bookings
FROM bookings b
JOIN customer_profiles cp ON b.customer_id = cp.id
WHERE b.payment_status = 'pending'
  AND b.stripe_checkout_session_id IS NULL
GROUP BY cp.email, cp.first_name, cp.last_name, cp.phone
ORDER BY unpaid_bookings DESC;
```

Send email to customers:
- Inform them their booking is pending payment
- Provide payment link
- Offer to rebook with discount code

#### Option B: Cancel Old Unpaid Bookings
```sql
-- Mark as cancelled after 48 hours
UPDATE bookings
SET 
  booking_status = 'cancelled',
  cancellation_reason = 'Payment not completed within 48 hours',
  cancelled_at = NOW()
WHERE payment_status = 'pending'
  AND stripe_checkout_session_id IS NULL
  AND created_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '48 hours';
```

#### Option C: Manual Payment Collection
For valuable bookings:
1. Contact customer directly
2. Create manual Stripe invoice
3. Update booking after payment

-- Daily paid bookings rate
SELECT 
  DATE(created_at) as date,
  COUNT(*) as total_bookings,
  SUM(CASE WHEN payment_status = 'paid' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as paid_bookings,
  ROUND(100.0 * SUM(CASE WHEN payment_status = 'paid' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(*), 2) as payment_rate
FROM bookings
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'

## 🎓 Key Learnings

### What We Fixed

1. **Architecture Issue**: Booking-first vs payment-first flow
2. **Data Integrity**: Orphaned unpaid bookings
3. **Field Names**: CamelCase vs snake_case consistency
4. **Webhook Logic**: Create vs update booking
5. **Database Schema**: Correct column names for transactions

### Best Practices Applied

✅ **Payment-First Architecture**
- Only create bookings after successful payment
- Store all data in Stripe metadata
- Let webhooks drive database updates

✅ **Consistent Naming**
- Use snake_case for database fields
- Match field names across frontend/backend
- Follow PostgreSQL naming conventions

✅ **Proper Transaction Recording**
- Payment transactions for Stripe records
- Financial transactions for audit trail
- Business payment transactions for tax reporting

✅ **Promotion Handling**
- Track promotion usage after payment
- Link to booking correctly
- Record discount amounts accurately

## 📞 Support & Monitoring

### If Issues Arise

1. **Check Webhook Logs**:
   - Stripe Dashboard → Developers → Webhooks → Event logs
   - Look for `checkout.session.completed` events
   - Check for any failures or errors

2. **Check Vercel Logs**:
   - Vercel Dashboard → roam-customer-app → Functions
   - Filter by `/api/stripe/webhook`
   - Look for error messages

3. **Check Database**:
   ```sql
   -- Recently created bookings
   SELECT * FROM bookings WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour';
   
   -- Failed webhook processing (look for bookings that might not have been created)
   -- Check Stripe dashboard for checkout sessions without corresponding bookings
   ```

4. **Rollback if Necessary**:
   ```bash
   # Find previous working deployment
   vercel rollback roam-customer-app
   
   # Or via Vercel dashboard
   # https://vercel.com/roam-5720c218/roam-customer-app
   ```
