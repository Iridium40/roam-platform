# Delivery Type & Location Selection - Booking Flow Implementation

**Date**: October 3, 2025
**Status**: ✅ IMPLEMENTED

## Overview

Implemented comprehensive delivery type and location selection in the customer booking flow. Customers can now choose how they want to receive services (Business, Mobile, Virtual) and select or create locations accordingly.

## 🎯 Requirements Implemented

### 1. **Delivery Type Selection**
- ✅ Added delivery type selection step in booking flow

- ✅ Visual indicators with icons for each delivery type

### 2. **Business Location Selection**
- ✅ Loads business locations from database
- ✅ Auto-selects if only one location exists
- ✅ Auto-selects primary location if multiple exist
- ✅ Displays full address information

### 3. **Customer Location Selection**
- ✅ Loads customer's saved locations
- ✅ Auto-selects primary location
- ✅ Allows selection of existing locations
- ✅ Enables creating new locations inline
- ✅ Saves new locations to database

### 4. **Virtual Service Handling**

## 📋 Booking Flow Logic

```
Date & Time → Business → Delivery Type → Location → Provider → Summary → Checkout
```

### Step Transitions

1. **DateTime → Business**: Standard flow
2. **Business → Delivery/Provider**: 
   - If only 1 delivery type → skip to Provider
   - If multiple delivery types → go to Delivery selection
3. **Delivery → Location/Provider**:
   - Business location → Location step (select business address)
   - Mobile → Location step (select/create customer address)
   - Virtual → skip to Provider (no location needed)
4. **Location → Provider**: Standard flow
5. **Provider → Summary**: Standard flow
6. **Summary → Checkout**: Stripe checkout with all metadata

### Frontend (`roam-customer-app/client/pages/BookService.tsx`)

#### Added Interfaces
```typescript
interface BusinessLocation {
  id: string;
  location_name: string | null;
  address_line1: string;
  address_line2: string | null;
  city: string;
  state: string;
  postal_code: string;
  country: string | null;
  is_primary: boolean;
  is_active: boolean;
}

interface CustomerLocation {
  id: string;
  location_name: string;
  street_address: string;
  unit_number: string | null;
  city: string;
  state: string;
  zip_code: string;
  is_primary: boolean;
  is_active: boolean;
  location_type: string;
}
```

#### Added State Variables
```typescript
const [selectedDeliveryType, setSelectedDeliveryType] = useState<string>('');
const [businessLocations, setBusinessLocations] = useState<BusinessLocation[]>([]);
const [selectedBusinessLocation, setSelectedBusinessLocation] = useState<BusinessLocation | null>(null);
const [customerLocations, setCustomerLocations] = useState<CustomerLocation[]>([]);
const [selectedCustomerLocation, setSelectedCustomerLocation] = useState<CustomerLocation | null>(null);
const [newCustomerLocation, setNewCustomerLocation] = useState({...});
```

#### Added Functions
- `loadBusinessLocations(businessId)`: Fetch business locations from database

#### New UI Components
1. **Delivery Type Selection Step**
   - Card-based selection
   - Icons and labels for each type
   - Descriptions
   
2. **Location Selection Step**
   - Business locations: List of business addresses
   - Customer locations: Saved addresses + new address form
   - Visual indicators for primary locations
   - Location type badges (Home, Work, Other)

3. **Summary Enhancement**
   - Shows selected delivery type with icon

### Backend (`roam-customer-app/api/`)

#### `create-checkout-session.ts`
**Changes:**
```typescript
// Added to request parsing
const { 
  ...existing,
  businessLocationId,
  customerLocationId,
  ...rest
} = req.body;

// Added to Stripe metadata
metadata: {
  ...existing,
  business_location_id: businessLocationId || '',
  customer_location_id: customerLocationId || '',
  ...rest
}
```

#### `webhook.ts`
**Changes:**
```typescript
// Added to booking data
const bookingData = {
  ...existing,
  business_location_id: metadata.business_location_id || null,
  customer_location_id: metadata.customer_location_id || null,
  ...rest
};
```

---

## 🗄️ Database Schema

### Tables Used

#### `business_locations`
```sql
- id: uuid
- business_id: uuid
- location_name: varchar
- address_line1: varchar  -- ⚠️ Different from customer
- address_line2: varchar
- city: varchar
- state: varchar
- postal_code: varchar    -- ⚠️ Different from customer
- is_primary: boolean
- is_active: boolean
```

#### `customer_locations`
```sql
- id: uuid
- customer_id: uuid (references user_id)
- location_name: varchar
- street_address: text     -- ⚠️ Different from business
- unit_number: varchar
- city: varchar
- state: varchar
- zip_code: varchar        -- ⚠️ Different from business
- is_primary: boolean
- is_active: boolean
- location_type: enum (home, work, other)
```

#### `bookings` (Enhanced)
```sql
- delivery_type: varchar (business_location, customer_location, virtual)
- business_location_id: uuid (nullable)
- customer_location_id: uuid (nullable)
```

## 🔑 Key Implementation Details

### 1. **Smart Step Skipping**
```typescript
// Auto-skip delivery selection if only one type
const deliveryTypes = getDeliveryTypes(selectedBusiness);
if (deliveryTypes.length === 1) {
  setSelectedDeliveryType(deliveryTypes[0]);
  // Load locations if needed
  setCurrentStep('provider');
} else {
  setCurrentStep('delivery');
}
```

### 2. **Auto-Selection Logic**
```typescript
// Business locations
if (locations.length === 1) {
  setSelectedBusinessLocation(locations[0]);
} else {
  const primaryLocation = locations.find(loc => loc.is_primary);
  if (primaryLocation) setSelectedBusinessLocation(primaryLocation);
}

// Customer locations
const primaryLocation = locations.find(loc => loc.is_primary);
if (primaryLocation) setSelectedCustomerLocation(primaryLocation);
```

### 3. **Location Validation**
```typescript
// Before proceeding from location step
if (selectedDeliveryType === 'business_location') {
  if (!selectedBusinessLocation && businessLocations.length > 1) {
    // Show error
    return;
  }
} else if (selectedDeliveryType === 'customer_location') {
  if (!selectedCustomerLocation && customerLocations.length === 0) {
    // Validate new location form
    if (!newCustomerLocation.street_address || ...) {
      // Show error
      return;
    }
    // Save new location
    await saveNewCustomerLocation();
  }
}
```

### 4. **New Location Creation**
```typescript
const saveNewCustomerLocation = async () => {
  const { data, error } = await supabase
    .from('customer_locations')
    .insert({
      customer_id: customer.user_id,
      ...newCustomerLocation,
    })
    .select()
    .single();
    
  if (!error) {
    await loadCustomerLocations();
    return data;
  }
};
```
