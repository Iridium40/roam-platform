# Staff Invitation Email - Troubleshooting Guide

## Overview

The staff invitation feature allows business owners to invite team members (providers, dispatchers, owners) to join their business on the ROAM platform via email.

## How It Works

### Flow
1. **Owner fills out invite form** ‚Üí Email, Role, Location
2. **API creates invitation record** ‚Üí Stored in `providers` table with pending status
3. **Email sent via Resend** ‚Üí Contains unique onboarding link
4. **Staff member clicks link** ‚Üí Complete onboarding process
5. **Account activated** ‚Üí Staff can access platform

### Database
```sql
-- Invitation record created in providers table
INSERT INTO providers (
  email,
  provider_role,
  location_id,
  business_id,
  verification_status, -- 'pending'
  is_active,           -- false
  invitation_token,    -- JWT token
  invitation_sent_at   -- timestamp
)
```

## Common Issues & Solutions

### 1. Email Not Sending

**Symptoms:**
- Success message shows but email never arrives
- Console shows "Email may not have been delivered"
- Warning: "Invitation created (email delivery pending)"

**Possible Causes:**

#### A. RESEND_API_KEY Not Configured
```bash
# Check Vercel environment variables
# Should see: RESEND_API_KEY=re_xxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

**Solution:**
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí roam-provider-app ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
2. Add/Update `RESEND_API_KEY` with value from Resend dashboard
3. Redeploy the application

#### B. Invalid API Key Format
**Error in logs:** `‚ùå RESEND_API_KEY appears to be invalid`

**Solution:**
- API key must start with `re_`
- Get correct key from [Resend Dashboard](https://resend.com/api-keys)
- Update environment variable and redeploy

#### C. Sender Email Not Verified
**Error from Resend:** `Domain not verified` or `Email not verified`

**Solution:**
1. Go to [Resend Dashboard](https://resend.com/domains)
2. Verify `providersupport@roamyourbestlife.com` or the entire domain
3. Follow Resend's verification process (DNS records)
4. Wait for verification to complete (can take a few minutes)

### 2. 500 Internal Server Error

**Symptoms:**
- API returns 500 error
- Toast shows "Failed to Send Invitation"
- No invitation record created

**Debugging Steps:**

#### Check Vercel Logs
```bash
# In Vercel Dashboard
1. Go to roam-provider-app ‚Üí Deployments
2. Click on latest deployment
3. Go to Functions tab
4. Find /api/staff/invite
5. Check logs for detailed error
```

**Look for:**
- `‚ùå Resend API error:` - Email service issue
- `Error creating pending provider record:` - Database issue
- `Business not found` - Invalid business_id
- `Missing required fields` - Form validation issue

#### Common Errors:

**Database Connection Issue**
```
Error: Failed to create invitation record
```
**Solution:** Check `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` environment variable

**JWT Secret Missing**
```
Error: JWT_SECRET not configured
```
**Solution:** Add `JWT_SECRET` to Vercel environment variables

**Business Not Found**
```
Error: Business not found
```
**Solution:** Verify business_id exists in database

---

### 3. Duplicate Email Error

**Symptoms:**
- Error: "This email is already associated with your business"
- Invitation form rejects submission

**Cause:**
A provider record already exists with this email for this business

**Solutions:**

1. **If staff member already has account:**
   - They can login directly
   - No need for new invitation

2. **If previous invitation was sent:**
   - Check providers table for pending invitation
   - Resend the original invitation link
   - Or delete the old record and create new one

3. **Manual cleanup (if needed):**
```sql
-- Find pending invitation
SELECT * FROM providers 
WHERE email = 'staff@example.com' 
  AND business_id = 'your-business-id'
  AND verification_status = 'pending';

-- Delete if necessary (be careful!)
DELETE FROM providers 
WHERE email = 'staff@example.com' 
  AND business_id = 'your-business-id'
  AND verification_status = 'pending'
  AND is_active = false;
```

### 4. Email Goes to Spam

**Symptoms:**
- Email sends successfully
- Staff member doesn't receive it
- Found in spam folder

**Solutions:**

1. **Ask staff to check spam/junk folder**
2. **Whitelist sender address:**
   - Add `providersupport@roamyourbestlife.com` to contacts
3. **Domain reputation:**
   - Configure SPF, DKIM, DMARC records in Resend
   - Warm up domain by sending emails gradually
4. **Email content:**
   - Already follows best practices
   - Professional subject line
   - Clear sender name
   - Proper HTML formatting

---

### 5. Invitation Link Expired

**Symptoms:**
- Staff clicks link
- Error: "Invalid or expired invitation"
- Link doesn't work

**Cause:**
Invitation tokens expire after 7 days

**Solutions:**

1. **Resend invitation:**
   - Delete old invitation record
   - Send new invitation
   - New 7-day token generated

2. **Extend token expiry (if needed):**
```typescript
// In api/staff/invite.ts
const invitationToken = jwt.sign(
  { businessId, email, role, locationId },
  process.env.JWT_SECRET,
  { expiresIn: '14d' } // Change from 7d to 14d
);
```
