# Turnstile CAPTCHA Quick Fix

## ✅ Problem Resolved

The Turnstile widget wasn't appearing because the environment variables weren't set in your local `.env.local` file.

## ✅ What I Did

1. ✅ Added Turnstile environment variables to `roam-customer-app/.env.local`
2. ✅ Added error handling to show a helpful message if env vars are missing
3. ✅ Updated the widget to only render when properly configured

## 🔄 Next Step: Restart Your Dev Server

**IMPORTANT:** Environment variables are only loaded when the Vite dev server starts. You MUST restart it!

### If you're running locally:

1. **Stop** your current dev server (Ctrl+C or Cmd+C)
2. **Restart** it:
   ```bash
   cd roam-customer-app
   npm run dev
   ```

### If you're running via Vercel:

The environment variables need to be added to Vercel dashboard:
1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) → Your Project
2. Settings → Environment Variables
3. Add:
   - `VITE_TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY` = `0x4AAAAAAB9zmfe1ptXiTDgH`
   - `TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY` = `0x4AAAAAAB9zmVx5NPATYoBZ5FXSLHgfeEM`
4. Redeploy

## ✅ After Restart

You should see:
- ✅ The Cloudflare Turnstile widget appears below the email input
- ✅ No "Please verify you're not a robot" error message
- ✅ Form submissions work correctly

## 🔍 Verification

After restarting, visit `http://localhost:5174` (or your dev URL) and check:

1. **Widget appears**: You should see the Cloudflare Turnstile widget
2. **No errors in console**: Open browser DevTools (F12) → Console tab
3. **Form works**: Try submitting the form

## ❌ If Still Not Working

1. **Check console for errors** (F12 → Console)
2. **Verify environment variables** are loaded:
   ```javascript
   // In browser console, type:
   import.meta.env.VITE_TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY
   // Should show: "0x4AAAAAAB9zmfe1ptXiTDgH"
   ```
3. **Hard refresh**: Ctrl+Shift+R (Cmd+Shift+R on Mac)
4. **Clear browser cache**

## 📝 Summary

- **Local Development**: Environment variables added to `.env.local` ✅
- **Production**: Still need to add to Vercel environment variables
- **Code**: Updated with proper error handling ✅
- **Next Action**: **RESTART DEV SERVER** 🔄

## 🚀 Deployment

When deploying to production, make sure to add these to Vercel:
- `VITE_TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY`
- `TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY`

See `VERCEL_ENV_VARS.md` for detailed instructions.
