ROAM Platform Overview
Based on your codebase, I can see you have a well-structured monorepo for the ROAM Platform with three main applications:

üèóÔ∏è Platform Architecture
Core Applications
ROAM Admin App - Platform administration and management
ROAM Provider App - Provider onboarding, management, and service delivery
ROAM Customer App - Customer booking and service discovery
Shared Services Layer
@roam/shared - Common types, utilities, validation schemas, and formatting
@roam/auth-service - Centralized JWT authentication and RBAC
@roam/notification-service - Email (Resend), SMS (Twilio), and push notifications
@roam/payment-service - Stripe payments and Connect integration
üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack
Monorepo Management: Turbo
Language: TypeScript with comprehensive type safety
Database: Supabase
Payments: Stripe with Connect for providers
Communications: Twilio (SMS), Resend (Email)
Deployment: Vercel with independent app deployment
üìä Key Benefits
40-60% code reduction through shared packages
Type-safe development across all applications
Independent deployment of apps and services
Unified validation and formatting utilities
Consistent API contracts between services
The platform appears to be a marketplace connecting customers with service providers, with robust admin oversight capabilities. Each app can be developed and deployed independently while sharing core business logic and utilities.

Vercel is used for deployments
