# Resend Audience Integration

**Date:** October 8, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Complete

## Overview

Integrated Resend audience management to automatically add provider and customer contacts to their respective audiences when emails are sent. This enables better email marketing, segmentation, and communication tracking.

## Audience IDs

### Provider Audience
- **Audience ID:** `4c85891b-bc03-4e67-a744-30b92e43206f`
- **Purpose:** All providers, staff members, business owners, and dispatchers
- **Email Domain:** `providersupport@roamyourbestlife.com`

### Customer Audience
- **Audience ID:** `92cddc48-ccba-4a39-83f0-eecc114e80a6`
- **Purpose:** All customers who sign up for the ROAM app
- **Email Domain:** `support@roamyourbestlife.com`

## Implementation Details

### Provider Email Service (`roam-provider-app/server/services/emailService.ts`)

#### New Method: `addToProviderAudience()`
```typescript
static async addToProviderAudience(
  email: string,
  firstName?: string,
  lastName?: string
): Promise<boolean>
```

**Features:**
- Automatically adds contacts to the provider Resend audience
- Handles duplicate contacts gracefully (returns true if already exists)
- Comprehensive error logging
- Used in all provider email methods

#### Integration Points
The `addToProviderAudience()` method is now called in:
1. ✅ `sendWelcomeEmail()` - When a new provider signs up
2. ✅ `sendApplicationApprovedEmail()` - When provider application is approved
3. ✅ `sendOnboardingCompleteEmail()` - When provider completes onboarding
4. ✅ `sendStaffInvitationEmail()` - When staff members are invited

### Customer Email Service (`roam-customer-app/server/services/emailService.ts`)

#### New Method: `addToCustomerAudience()`
```typescript
static async addToCustomerAudience(
  email: string,
  firstName?: string,
  lastName?: string
): Promise<boolean>
```

**Features:**
- Automatically adds customer contacts to the customer Resend audience
- Handles duplicate contacts gracefully (returns true if already exists)
- Comprehensive error logging
- Ready for future customer email implementations

**Note:** Customer email methods (welcome, booking confirmation, etc.) still need to be implemented. When they are created, simply call `await this.addToCustomerAudience(email, firstName, lastName)` before sending the email.

## API Configuration

Both services use the Resend SDK which requires the `RESEND_API_KEY` environment variable:

```bash
RESEND_API_KEY=re_xxxxxxxxx
```

### Resend API Endpoint (for reference)
```bash
curl -X POST 'https://api.resend.com/audiences/{AUDIENCE_ID}/contacts' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer re_xxxxxxxxx' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "first_name": "John",
    "last_name": "Doe",
    "unsubscribed": false
  }'
```

## Error Handling

Both methods include robust error handling:

1. **Missing API Key:** Logs error and returns `false`
2. **Invalid API Key:** Validates format (must start with `re_`)
3. **Duplicate Contact:** Gracefully handles if contact already exists (returns `true`)
4. **API Errors:** Detailed logging with full error details
5. **Exceptions:** Catches and logs all exceptions

## Testing

### Manual Testing - Provider Audience
1. **Staff Invitation:**
   - Go to Provider App → Staff Management
   - Invite a new staff member with an email
   - Check Resend dashboard to verify contact was added to provider audience

2. **Manual Staff Creation:**
   - Go to Provider App → Staff Management
   - Manually create a staff member
   - Check Resend dashboard to verify contact was added

3. **Provider Signup:**
   - Sign up a new provider account
   - Verify welcome email is sent
   - Check Resend dashboard to verify contact was added

### Manual Testing - Customer Audience
- Customer emails are not yet implemented
- When implemented, test by signing up a new customer and verifying they're added to the customer audience
