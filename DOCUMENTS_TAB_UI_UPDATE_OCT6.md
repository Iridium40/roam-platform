## What Changed

### 1. Removed Edit Controls from Documents Tab
**File:** `BusinessSettingsTabRefactored.tsx`

The Cancel and Save Changes buttons no longer appear when viewing the Documents tab.

**Implementation:**
```typescript
const showEditControls = isEditableTab && hasUnsavedChanges;
```

Only shows edit controls when BOTH conditions are true:
- User is on an editable tab (Basic Info or Hours)
- User has unsaved changes

### 2. Added View Button to Each Document
**File:** `DocumentsSection.tsx`

Each uploaded document now has a View button that opens the document in a new tab.

**Buttons per document:**
- 📤 **Upload** - When no document uploaded yet
- 👁️ **View** - Opens document in new tab  
- 🗑️ **Delete** - Removes document
