# üö® Stripe Checkout Issue - Root Cause & Fix

## Problem
After successful Stripe checkout, the booking is **NOT being created** in the database.

## Root Cause Analysis

### ‚ùå What's Happening:
1. User completes Stripe checkout successfully
2. Stripe redirects to BookingSuccess page with `session_id`
3. BookingSuccess page queries database for booking
4. **Booking doesn't exist** ‚Üí 406 error (because `.single()` expects 1 result, gets 0)
5. Page retries 10 times, fails each time

### üîç Why Booking Doesn't Exist:
The **Stripe webhook** (`checkout.session.completed`) is supposed to create the booking, but it's either:
- Not registered in Stripe Dashboard
- Not being sent by Stripe  
- Failing (signature verification or code error)
- Missing environment variables in Vercel

## ‚úÖ Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed Code Issue ‚úÖ
**File:** `roam-customer-app/api/stripe/webhook.ts`

**Removed duplicate variable declarations:**
```typescript
// BEFORE (had duplicates - lines 119-120)
const platformFee = parseFloat(metadata.platform_fee || '0'); // duplicate!
const totalAmount = parseFloat(metadata.total_amount); // duplicate!
const businessAmount = totalAmount - platformFee;

// AFTER (fixed)
const businessAmount = totalAmount - platformFee;
```

## üîß What You Need To Do

### Step 1: Check Webhook Registration in Stripe üéØ **CRITICAL**

1. Go to: https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/webhooks
2. **Look for a webhook with this URL:**
   ```
   https://roamservices.app/api/stripe/webhook
   ```

#### If Webhook DOES NOT Exist:
**Create it now:**
1. Click "Add endpoint"
2. Endpoint URL: `https://roamservices.app/api/stripe/webhook`
3. Events to send: Select `checkout.session.completed`
4. Click "Add endpoint"
5. **Copy the signing secret** (starts with `whsec_...`)
6. Go to Step 2 to add it to Vercel

#### If Webhook EXISTS:
1. Click on it
2. Check "Events" tab for recent deliveries
3. Look for failures (red X icons)
4. Click failed events to see error details

---

### Step 2: Verify Vercel Environment Variables üéØ **CRITICAL**

1. Go to: https://vercel.com/roam-5720c218/roam-customer-app/settings/environment-variables

2. **Verify these variables exist for PRODUCTION:**
   - ‚úÖ `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` (starts with `sk_test_...`)
   - ‚úÖ `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SIGNING_SECRET` (starts with `whsec_...`) ‚Üê **Most likely missing!**
   - ‚úÖ `VITE_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
   - ‚úÖ `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`

3. **If `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SIGNING_SECRET` is missing or wrong:**
   - Get it from: Stripe Dashboard ‚Üí Webhooks ‚Üí Your endpoint ‚Üí "Signing secret"
   - Add it to Vercel environment variables
   - Set for: **Production** environment
   - **Important:** Redeploy after adding (changes take effect on next deployment)

---

### Step 3: Deploy the Code Fix

```bash
# Commit and push the webhook fix
git add roam-customer-app/api/stripe/webhook.ts
git commit -m "fix: remove duplicate variable declarations in Stripe webhook handler"
git push origin main
```

Wait ~8 minutes for Vercel deployment to complete.

---

### Step 4: Test the Webhook

#### Option A: Send Test Event from Stripe Dashboard
1. Go to: https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/webhooks
2. Click your webhook endpoint
3. Click "Send test webhook"
4. Select: `checkout.session.completed`
5. Click "Send test webhook"
6. Check if booking appears in database

#### Option B: Make a Real Test Booking
1. Go to https://roamservices.app
2. Select a service and complete booking flow
3. Use test card: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
4. Monitor Vercel logs for webhook activity

---

### Step 5: Monitor Webhook Delivery

#### Check Vercel Logs:
```bash
# Real-time logs
vercel logs roam-customer-app --follow

# Or view in dashboard
https://vercel.com/roam-5720c218/roam-customer-app/logs
```

#### Look for these log messages:
- ‚úÖ `Processing webhook event: checkout.session.completed`
- ‚úÖ `üíæ Creating booking from checkout session: BK25ABC10001`
- ‚úÖ `‚úÖ Booking created successfully: <uuid>`
- ‚ùå `Webhook signature verification failed` ‚Üí Wrong signing secret
- ‚ùå `‚ùå Error creating booking:` ‚Üí Database/RLS issue

#### Check Stripe Dashboard:
1. Go to webhook events
2. Recent events should show **green checkmarks** ‚úÖ
3. Red X = failure (click to see error)

## üéØ Quick Checklist

- [ ] Webhook registered in Stripe Dashboard
- [ ] `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SIGNING_SECRET` set in Vercel
- [ ] Code fix committed and deployed
- [ ] Test webhook sent from Stripe Dashboard
- [ ] Booking created in database
- [ ] BookingSuccess page works (no 406 errors)

---

## üîç Verify Booking Was Created

```sql
-- Run this in Supabase SQL editor
SELECT 
  id, 
  booking_reference, 
  stripe_checkout_session_id, 
  payment_status,
  booking_status,
  total_amount,
  created_at
FROM bookings
WHERE stripe_checkout_session_id IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

Expected result:
- `payment_status` = `'paid'`
- `booking_status` = `'confirmed'`
- `stripe_checkout_session_id` = your session ID

## üí° Why This Happened

The payment-first architecture (Option 1) requires the webhook to create bookings after successful payment. The webhook must be:
1. ‚úÖ Registered in Stripe
2. ‚úÖ Configured with correct signing secret
3. ‚úÖ Have access to Supabase (service role key)
4. ‚úÖ Working code (no errors)

Without all 4, bookings won't be created even though payment succeeds.

## üÜò Still Not Working?

If after following all steps the booking still doesn't exist:

1. **Check Vercel logs** for error messages
2. **Check Stripe webhook delivery status** for failures
3. **Verify RLS policies** on `bookings` table (service role key should bypass)
4. **Check Supabase logs** for database errors
5. Share error messages for further debugging
