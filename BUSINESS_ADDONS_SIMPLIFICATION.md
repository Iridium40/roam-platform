# Business Add-ons Simplification

## Overview
Implemented a simplified add-ons management system following the same pattern as the services page. Add-ons are automatically displayed based on compatibility with the business's active services through the `service_addon_eligibility` table.

## Database Structure

### Tables Involved

1. **`service_addons`** - Master add-on catalog
   - Global add-ons available across the platform
   - Fields: id, name, description, image_url, is_active

2. **`service_addon_eligibility`** - Defines which add-ons can be used with which services
   - Links services to compatible add-ons
   - Fields: id, service_id, addon_id, is_recommended

3. **`business_addons`** - Business-specific add-on configuration
   - Custom pricing and availability per business
   - Fields: id, business_id, addon_id, custom_price, is_available
   - Unique constraint on (business_id, addon_id)

## Implementation

### Components Created

#### `AddonsTabSimplified.tsx`
- Main container for add-ons management
- Shows all eligible add-ons in unified view
- Includes filters for search and status
- Displays add-on stats

#### `SimplifiedAddonListSection.tsx`
- Table display of all eligible add-ons
- Shows configuration status (configured/unconfigured)
- Displays compatible service count for each add-on
- Availability toggle (only enabled after configuration)
- Configure/Edit button

#### `EditAddonModal.tsx`
- Modal for configuring/editing add-on settings
- Fields:
  - **Custom Price**: Business's price for the add-on
  - **Availability Status**: Toggle to make add-on available
- Shows compatible service count
- Visual display of add-on details

#### `useSimplifiedAddons.ts`
- Custom hook for loading and managing eligible add-ons
- Fetches from `/api/business-eligible-addons` endpoint
- Returns add-ons with business configuration merged
- Calculates add-on stats
- Actions for updating and toggling add-on availability

#### Supporting Components
- `AddonStatsSection.tsx` - Stats cards for add-ons
- `AddonFiltersSection.tsx` - Search and filter controls

### Type Definitions

#### `addons.ts`
```typescript
interface EligibleAddon {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  image_url?: string;
  is_active: boolean;
  is_configured?: boolean;
  custom_price?: number | null;
  is_available?: boolean | null;
  compatible_service_count?: number;
  compatible_services?: string[];
}

interface AddonStats {
  total_addons: number;
  available_addons: number;
  total_revenue: number;
  avg_price: number;
}
```

## API Endpoints

### `GET /api/business-eligible-addons?business_id={id}`

**Purpose**: Fetch all add-ons eligible for a business based on active services

**Logic Flow**:
1. Get all active services for the business from `business_services`
2. Query `service_addon_eligibility` to find compatible add-ons
3. Get add-on details from `service_addons`
4. Merge with business configuration from `business_addons`
5. Count compatible services for each add-on

**Response**:
```json
{
  "business_id": "uuid",
  "addon_count": 5,
  "eligible_addons": [
    {
      "id": "uuid",
      "name": "Premium Cleaning Products",
      "description": "Eco-friendly cleaning materials",
      "image_url": "...",
      "is_active": true,
      "is_configured": true,
      "custom_price": 25.00,
      "is_available": true,
      "compatible_service_count": 3
    }
  ]
}
```

### `PUT /api/business/addons`

**Purpose**: Update or create business add-on configuration

**Request Body**:
```json
{
  "business_id": "uuid",
  "addon_id": "uuid",
  "custom_price": 25.00,
  "is_available": true
}
```

**Logic**:
- Upserts to `business_addons` table
- If exists: updates custom_price and is_available
- If new: inserts new record

**Response**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "addon": {
    "id": "uuid",
    "business_id": "uuid",
    "addon_id": "uuid",
    "custom_price": 25.00,
    "is_available": true
  }
}
```

## User Experience Flow

1. **Initial View**: Business sees all add-ons compatible with their active services
2. **Unconfigured Add-ons**: Show with muted background, "Not set" for price
3. **Configure Add-on**: Click "Configure" → Set custom price and availability
4. **Configured Add-ons**: Show with price and availability toggle enabled
5. **Edit Add-on**: Click "Edit" to modify price/availability

## Eligibility Rules

An add-on is eligible for a business if:
1. The add-on is active (`service_addons.is_active = true`)
2. The business has at least one active service (`business_services.is_active = true`)
3. That service is linked to the add-on in `service_addon_eligibility`

**Example**:
- Business has "House Cleaning" service active
- "Premium Cleaning Products" add-on is linked to "House Cleaning" in `service_addon_eligibility`
- Therefore, "Premium Cleaning Products" appears as eligible for the business

## Integration with Services Tab

The add-ons functionality is integrated into the Services page using tabs:

```tsx
<Tabs>
  <TabsList>
    <TabsTrigger value="services">Services</TabsTrigger>
    <TabsTrigger value="addons">Add-ons</TabsTrigger>
  </TabsList>
  
  <TabsContent value="services">
    {/* Services management */}
  </TabsContent>
  
  <TabsContent value="addons">
    <AddonsTabSimplified />
  </TabsContent>
</Tabs>
```

## Key Features

✅ **Automatic Eligibility**: Add-ons automatically appear based on active services
✅ **Visual Clarity**: Unconfigured add-ons clearly marked
✅ **Compatible Services**: Shows how many services each add-on works with
✅ **Simple Configuration**: Just set price and availability
✅ **Status Management**: Toggle availability after configuration
✅ **Search & Filter**: Find add-ons quickly
✅ **Stats Dashboard**: Track add-on metrics

## Add-on States

- **Eligible but Unconfigured**: is_configured = false, custom_price = null
- **Configured but Unavailable**: is_configured = true, is_available = false
- **Configured and Available**: is_configured = true, is_available = true

## Validation & Constraints

1. **Database Trigger**: `validate_business_addon_eligibility_trigger`
   - Validates add-on is actually eligible for the business
   - Prevents adding incompatible add-ons

2. **Unique Constraint**: Business can only configure each add-on once
   - Constraint: `business_addon_pricing_business_id_addon_id_key`

3. **Price Validation**: Custom price must be ≥ 0

## Benefits

1. **Contextual Add-ons**: Only show add-ons relevant to business's services
2. **Automatic Discovery**: No need to search - all options visible
3. **Clear Compatibility**: See which services each add-on works with
4. **Flexible Pricing**: Each business sets their own add-on prices
5. **Simple Toggle**: Easy to enable/disable add-ons

## Example Scenario

**Business**: "Elite Wellness Spa"

**Active Services**:
- IV Therapy
- Vitamin Injections  
- Health Consultations

**Eligible Add-ons** (from `service_addon_eligibility`):
- Blood Test (compatible with IV Therapy, Health Consultations) - 2 services
- Mobile Service (compatible with IV Therapy, Vitamin Injections) - 2 services
- Rush Service (compatible with all 3) - 3 services

**Configuration**:
- Blood Test: $75 custom price, Available
- Mobile Service: $50 custom price, Unavailable (temporarily disabled)
- Rush Service: Not configured yet
