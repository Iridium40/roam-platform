# üö® IMMEDIATE FIX - Turnstile CAPTCHA Not Showing

## Problem
You're seeing the error: "Please verify you're not a robot" but no CAPTCHA widget appears.

## Root Cause
The environment variable `VITE_TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY` is not set in your Vercel deployment.

## ‚úÖ Quick Fix (Takes 2 Minutes)

### Option 1: Add to Vercel (Production Site)

Since you're viewing `roamyourbestlife.com`, you need to add env vars to Vercel:

1. **Go to**: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. **Select** your project (roam-customer-app)
3. **Click**: Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
4. **Add these two variables**:

   ```
   Variable Name: VITE_TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY
   Value: 0x4AAAAAAB9zmfe1ptXiTDgH
   Environment: Production, Preview, Development (select all)
   ```

   ```
   Variable Name: TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY
   Value: 0x4AAAAAAB9zmVx5NPATYoBZ5FXSLHgfeEM
   Environment: Production, Preview, Development (select all)
   ```

5. **Save** the variables
6. **Redeploy**: 
   - Go to Deployments tab
   - Click ‚ãØ on latest deployment
   - Click "Redeploy"

### Option 2: Wait for Next Auto-Deploy

If you just added the variables, commit and push your code:

```bash
cd /Users/alans/Desktop/ROAM/roam-platform
git add .
git commit -m "Add Turnstile CAPTCHA configuration"
git push
```

Vercel will automatically deploy with the new variables.

### Option 3: Local Testing

For local development:

```bash
cd roam-customer-app
npm run dev
```

The environment variables are already in `.env.local` ‚úÖ
