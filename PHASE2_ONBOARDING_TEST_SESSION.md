# Phase 2 Onboarding Test Session - October 7, 2025

## Session Summary

### ‚úÖ **SUCCESS:** Complete Phase 1 ‚Üí Phase 2 Flow Tested

You successfully completed the **full approval workflow**:

1. ‚úÖ Submitted business documents in Phase 1 onboarding
2. ‚úÖ Business verified and approved in ROAM Admin App  
3. ‚úÖ Welcome email received with Phase 2 link
4. ‚úÖ Clicked Phase 2 link and reached Welcome step

---

## Issue Found & Fixed

### Problem
When clicking the Phase 2 link from the email, you reached the Welcome screen but encountered this error:

```
GET http://localhost:5177/api/onboarding/phase2-progress/79e8d151-b07e-4ce7-a21f-cf8143da6ac3 404 (Not Found)
```

### Root Cause
The local development server (`roam-provider-app/server/index.ts`) was missing the GET route for fetching Phase 2 progress. The endpoint file existed (`api/onboarding/phase2-progress/[businessId].ts`) but wasn't registered in the Express server.

### Fix Applied ‚úÖ
Added the missing GET route to `roam-provider-app/server/index.ts`:

```typescript
// GET Phase 2 progress by business ID
app.get("/api/onboarding/phase2-progress/:businessId",
  requirePhase2Access(),
  async (req: AuthenticatedRequest, res) => {
    try {
      const progressHandler = await import(
        "../api/onboarding/phase2-progress/[businessId]"
      );
      // Transform Express req to match Vercel format
      const vercelReq = {
        ...req,
        query: { businessId: req.params.businessId }
      };
      await progressHandler.default(vercelReq as any, res as any);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("Error importing get phase2 progress handler:", error);
      res
        .status(500)
        .json({ error: "Failed to load get phase2 progress handler" });
    }
  }
);
```

**Server restarted** - Fix is now active on port 5177.

---

## Test Business Details

From the error log, your test business:

- **Business ID:** `79e8d151-b07e-4ce7-a21f-cf8143da6ac3`
- **Status:** Approved
- **Current Phase:** Phase 2 (Welcome step)
- **Progress:** Starting fresh (no previous Phase 2 progress)

---

## Database Tables Involved

Phase 2 onboarding updates these tables:

1. `business_profiles` - Business info, logo_url, cover_image_url
2. `business_providers` - Personal profile, avatar_url
3. `business_hours` - Operating hours
4. `business_staff` - Team members (if applicable)
5. `business_services` - Enabled services with pricing
6. `business_addons` - Service add-ons
7. `business_setup_progress` - Phase 2 completion tracking
8. `stripe_accounts` - Payment processing (if configured)

---

## How Phase 2 Access Works

### Token-Based Security
When you receive the approval email, it contains a secure JWT token:

1. **Token Generation** (Admin App)
   - Created when business is approved
   - Contains: business_id, user_id, application_id
   - Valid for 7 days
   - Signed with JWT_SECRET

2. **Token Validation** (Provider App)
   - User clicks email link
   - `Phase2Entry.tsx` validates token
   - Creates session in `sessionStorage`
   - Redirects to Phase 2 Welcome

3. **Session Management**
   - Session stored in browser
   - Valid for 2 hours
   - Middleware `requirePhase2Access()` checks session
   - No login required for Phase 2 onboarding

---

## Alternative Testing Methods

If you need to bypass the email flow for testing:

### Option 1: Direct Access
```
http://localhost:5177/provider-onboarding/phase2/entry?direct=true
```

### Option 2: Test Mode
```
http://localhost:5177/provider-onboarding/phase2/entry?test=true
```

### Option 3: Phase 2 Test Page
```
http://localhost:5177/phase2-test
```
- Test individual steps
- Pre-filled test data
- No email/token required

---

## Next Steps After Testing

Once you complete Phase 2 onboarding:

1. **Verify in Supabase Dashboard**
   - Check all tables for your business_id
   - Verify images uploaded to storage buckets
   - Confirm business_setup_progress shows all steps completed

2. **Test Provider Dashboard Access**
   - Should redirect automatically after completion
   - Verify all Phase 2 data displays correctly
   - Test booking flow (if ready)

3. **Report Findings**
   - Document any issues encountered
   - Note any UX improvements needed
   - Share successful completion screenshots

location.reload();
```

### Check Server Status
```bash
lsof -ti:5177
```

### View Server Logs
Check terminal where `npm run dev` is running for errors

### Database Inspection
