- Automatically sets first location as primary
- Validates required fields (address, city, state, postal_code)
- Supports mobile service configuration

✅ **Update Location**
- Edit existing location details
- Update address, contact info, mobile service settings
- Maintains data integrity with business_id validation

✅ **Delete Location**
- Remove locations with confirmation
- Prevents deletion of primary location if other locations exist
- Provides helpful error messages

✅ **Set Primary Location**
- Designate a location as primary
- Automatically unsets previous primary location
- Single transaction to ensure data consistency

## Database Schema Used

```sql
-- From DATABASE_SCHEMA_REFERENCE.md
create table public.business_locations (
  id uuid not null default gen_random_uuid(),
  business_id uuid not null,
  location_name character varying(255) null,
  address_line1 character varying(255) null,
  address_line2 character varying(255) null,
  city character varying(100) null,
  state character varying(100) null,
  postal_code character varying(20) null,
  country character varying(100) null,
  latitude double precision null,
  longitude double precision null,
  is_active boolean null default true,
  is_primary boolean null,
  offers_mobile_services boolean null,
  mobile_service_radius integer null,
  created_at timestamp without time zone null default now(),
  constraint business_locations_pkey primary key (id),
  constraint business_locations_business_id_fkey foreign KEY (business_id) 
    references business_profiles (id) on delete CASCADE
);
```

### Field Name Notes

⚠️ **Important:** Business locations use different field names than customer locations:
- `address_line1` / `address_line2` (NOT `street_address` / `unit_number`)
- `postal_code` (NOT `zip_code`)

## API Implementation Details

### 1. Load Business Locations

```typescript
const loadBusinessLocations = async () => {
  const { data, error } = await supabase
    .from('business_locations')
    .select('*')
    .eq('business_id', business.id)
    .order('is_primary', { ascending: false })
    .order('location_name', { ascending: true });
  
  if (error) {
    toast({ title: "Error", description: "Failed to load locations", variant: "destructive" });
  } else {
    setLocations(data || []);
  }
};
```

### 2. Add Location

```typescript
const handleLocationAdd = async (locationData: any) => {
  const isPrimary = locations.length === 0; // First location is primary
  
  const { data, error } = await supabase
    .from('business_locations')
    .insert({
      business_id: business.id,
      ...locationData,
      is_primary: isPrimary,
      is_active: true,
    })
    .select()
    .single();
  
  if (!error) {
    toast({ title: "Success", description: "Location added successfully" });
    await loadBusinessLocations();
  }
};
```

### 3. Update Location

```typescript
const handleLocationUpdate = async (locationId: string, locationData: any) => {
  const { error } = await supabase
    .from('business_locations')
    .update(locationData)
    .eq('id', locationId)
    .eq('business_id', business.id);
  
  if (!error) {
    toast({ title: "Success", description: "Location updated successfully" });
    await loadBusinessLocations();
  }
};
```

### 4. Delete Location

```typescript
const handleLocationDelete = async (locationId: string) => {
  const location = locations.find(loc => loc.id === locationId);
  
  // Prevent deletion of primary location if others exist
  if (location?.is_primary && locations.length > 1) {
    toast({
      title: "Cannot Delete",
      description: "Set another location as primary first.",
      variant: "destructive"
    });
    return;
  }
  
  const { error } = await supabase
    .from('business_locations')
    .delete()
    .eq('id', locationId)
    .eq('business_id', business.id);
  
  if (!error) {
    toast({ title: "Success", description: "Location deleted successfully" });
    await loadBusinessLocations();
  }
};
```

### 5. Set Primary Location

```typescript
const handleLocationSetPrimary = async (locationId: string) => {
  // Unset all primary flags
  await supabase
    .from('business_locations')
    .update({ is_primary: false })
    .eq('business_id', business.id);
  
  // Set new primary
  const { error } = await supabase
    .from('business_locations')
    .update({ is_primary: true })
    .eq('id', locationId)
    .eq('business_id', business.id);
  
  if (!error) {
    toast({ title: "Success", description: "Primary location updated" });
    await loadBusinessLocations();
  }
};
```

## User Experience

### Location Management Flow

   - Fill in form with address details
   - Optionally enable mobile services
   - First location automatically becomes primary

3. **Edit Location**
   - Click edit icon on location card
   - Modify any fields
   - Save changes with confirmation

4. **Delete Location**

## Error Handling

### Comprehensive Error Messages

✅ **Missing Business ID**
```typescript
if (!business?.id) return; // Guard clause in all handlers
```

✅ **Database Errors**
```typescript
catch (err) {
  console.error('Error loading locations:', err);
  toast({
    title: "Error",
    description: err instanceof Error ? err.message : "Failed to load locations",
    variant: "destructive"
  });
}
```

✅ **Primary Location Protection**
```typescript
if (location?.is_primary && locations.length > 1) {
  toast({
    title: "Cannot Delete",
    description: "Cannot delete primary location. Set another location as primary first.",
    variant: "destructive"
  });
  return;
}
```

## UI Components Integration

### LocationsSection Component

The existing `LocationsSection.tsx` component provides:

- ✅ Location form with all fields
- ✅ Primary/secondary location badges
- ✅ Mobile service configuration
- ✅ Address validation
- ✅ Edit/delete/set primary actions
- ✅ Responsive design
- ✅ Loading states

### Integration Points

```tsx
<LocationsSection
  businessId={business?.id}
  locations={locations}           // Loaded from database
  loading={locationsLoading}       // Loading state
  onLocationAdd={handleLocationAdd}
  onLocationUpdate={handleLocationUpdate}
  onLocationDelete={handleLocationDelete}
  onLocationSetPrimary={handleLocationSetPrimary}
/>
```

## Performance Considerations

### Optimizations Implemented

1. **Efficient Queries**
   ```sql
   -- Single query with ordering
   SELECT * FROM business_locations 
   WHERE business_id = $1
   ORDER BY is_primary DESC, location_name ASC
   ```

2. **Lazy Loading**
   - Locations only load when settings tab is accessed
   - Uses `React.useEffect` with business.id dependency

3. **Optimistic Updates**
   - Reload locations after each operation
   - Ensures UI stays in sync with database

---

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements

1. **Geocoding Integration**
   - Auto-populate latitude/longitude from address
   - Show locations on interactive map
   - Validate addresses with Google Maps API

2. **Service Area Visualization**
   - Show mobile service radius on map
   - Highlight coverage areas
   - Calculate distance to customer locations

3. **Location Analytics**
   - Track bookings per location
   - Revenue by location
   - Popular service areas

4. **Bulk Operations**
   - Import multiple locations from CSV
   - Bulk update mobile service settings
   - Clone location details
