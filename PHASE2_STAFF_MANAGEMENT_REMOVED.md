# Phase 2 Onboarding - Staff Management Removed

## Change Summary

Staff Management has been **removed from Phase 2 onboarding** and will be handled post-onboarding through the Provider Dashboard.

## Rationale

1. **Simplified Onboarding**: Owners can focus on getting their business profile set up first
2. **Better UX**: Staff invitations make more sense after the business is fully operational
3. **Cleaner Flow**: Reduces onboarding steps from 7 to 6
4. **Post-Approval Process**: Staff can be added anytime after business approval

---

## Updated Phase 2 Flow

### New Step Sequence:

1. **Welcome Back** - Phase 2 introduction
2. **Business Profile** - Logo, cover image, business details
3. **Personal Profile** - Avatar, bio, certifications
4. **Business Hours** - Operating hours and availability
5. **Banking & Payouts** - Payment processing setup
6. **Service Pricing** - Services and pricing structure
7. **Final Review** - Complete setup and go live

## Navigation Changes

### Before:
```
Business Hours → (if independent) → Banking & Payouts
Business Hours → (if business) → Staff Management → Banking & Payouts
```

### After:
```
Business Hours → Banking & Payouts
```

All business types now follow the same flow.

## Staff Management Access

### Where Staff is Now Managed:

**Provider Dashboard → Staff Management Section**

Once the business completes Phase 2 onboarding and is fully approved:

1. Owner logs into Provider App
2. Navigates to Staff Management tab
3. Can invite staff members via email
4. Staff receive invitation links
5. Staff complete their own onboarding via `/staff-onboarding` route

---

## Database Impact

### Tables NOT Modified:
- `business_setup_progress` - Still tracks progress, just doesn't require `staff_management_completed`
- `providers` table - Staff can still be added post-onboarding
- `business_staff` table - Unchanged

### Progress Tracking:
The `staff_management_completed` field in `business_setup_progress` is now optional and not checked during Phase 2 completion.

---

## Testing Notes

### What to Test:

1. **Phase 2 Flow**
   - Step 3 (Business Hours) should navigate directly to Step 4 (Banking & Payouts)
   - No staff management step should appear
   - Progress indicators should show 5 steps (not 6)

2. **Welcome Email**
   - Should show 5 setup steps (not 6)
   - Staff Management should NOT be listed

3. **Final Review**
   - Should show 5 completed sections
   - Staff Management should NOT appear in review

4. **Post-Onboarding**
   - Verify Staff Management is accessible from Provider Dashboard
   - Test staff invitation flow works independently

---

## Future Considerations

Staff Management features in the Provider Dashboard:
- Send invitation emails
- View all staff members
- Manage staff roles and permissions
- Deactivate/remove staff
- Track staff onboarding status
