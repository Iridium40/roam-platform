# My Bookings Page Diagnostic Report

## Investigation Summary

I've investigated why the `/my-bookings` page isn't showing real data. Here's what I found:

## ‚úÖ What's Working

1. **Database has bookings data**
   - Found 10 bookings across multiple customers
   - Example customers with bookings:
     - `d8ed1070-6358-45b8-a507-c37ea27e9ce0` (alan@roamyourbestlife.com) - 3 confirmed/paid bookings
     - `94a39c73-e33e-45fd-82ea-de9595da3a07` - 6 bookings (mostly pending)
     - `3ca13a92-b367-4623-aeff-d8dd590dd5a9` (alan@smithhealthwellness.com) - 1 completed booking

2. **Code is correct**
   - `useBookingsData` hook properly queries: `bookings.customer_id = currentUser.id`
   - Transforms data correctly for display
   - Includes proper error handling and retry logic

3. **RLS Policies are correct**
   - "Customers can view their own bookings" policy exists
   - Policy checks: `auth.uid() IN (SELECT user_id FROM customer_profiles WHERE id = bookings.customer_id)`
   - Also has "Allow anon read access" policy (security concern, but ensures data is readable)

4. **Authentication flow is correct**
   - AuthContext properly fetches customer profile
   - Stores customer data with `id` = `customer_profiles.id`
   - Stores `user_id` = `auth.users.id` for RLS

## üîç Root Cause Analysis

The issue is **NOT a code problem**. The most likely causes are:

### Issue 1: Not Logged In
- If you're visiting `/my-bookings` without being logged in, you won't see any data
- The page requires authentication

### Issue 2: Logged in as wrong user
- If you're logged in as a customer who has no bookings, the page will be empty
- Check which email you're logged in with

### Issue 3: Browser Console Errors
- There may be JavaScript errors preventing the fetch
- Check the browser console for errors

## üß™ How to Test

### Test 1: Check if you're logged in
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Run: `localStorage.getItem('roam_customer')`
3. You should see customer data with an `id` field

### Test 2: Check which customer you are
1. If logged in, note the `id` from localStorage
2. Check if that customer has bookings in the database

### Test 3: Try logging in as a customer with bookings
Known customers with bookings:
- `alan@roamyourbestlife.com` - Has 3 confirmed bookings
- `alan@smithhealthwellness.com` - Has 1 completed booking

## üîß Quick Fix Options

### Option 1: Create a test booking for your account
If you're logged in but have no bookings, you can:
1. Go to the booking flow
2. Create a test booking
3. Return to `/my-bookings` to see it

### Option 2: Log in as existing customer
Log out and log in as one of the customers with existing bookings.

### Option 3: Add debug logging
I can add temporary console logging to the production code to see exactly what's happening.

## üìä Database State

Current bookings by customer:
```
Customer: d8ed1070-6358-45b8-a507-c37ea27e9ce0 (alan@roamyourbestlife.com)
  - 3 bookings (all confirmed, paid)
  
Customer: 94a39c73-e33e-45fd-82ea-de9595da3a07
  - 6 bookings (5 pending, 1 declined)
  
Customer: 3ca13a92-b367-4623-aeff-d8dd590dd5a9 (alan@smithhealthwellness.com)
  - 1 booking (completed)
```

## üö® Security Issue Found

The bookings table has an RLS policy "Allow anon read access" with `qual: "true"`. This means **anyone** (even unauthenticated users) can read all bookings. This should be removed:

```sql
DROP POLICY "Allow anon read access" ON bookings;
```

## Next Steps

Please provide:
1. Screenshot of the my-bookings page
2. Browser console output (F12 ‚Üí Console tab)
3. The email you're logged in as (check localStorage with: `JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('roam_customer')).email`)

This will help me pinpoint the exact issue.
