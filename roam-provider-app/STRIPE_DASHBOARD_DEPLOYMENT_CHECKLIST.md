  .single();

console.log('Stripe Account:', data?.stripe_account_id); // Should not be null
```

console.log('Stripe Balance Response:', balance);
```

// Fix: Check Stripe account has payouts enabled
const account = await stripe.accounts.retrieve(stripeAccountId);
console.log('Payouts Enabled:', account.payouts_enabled);
```

### **Issue: Tax info won't save**
```typescript
// Fix: Verify API route exists and businessId is correct
console.log('Business ID:', businessId);
console.log('Tax Info Payload:', payload);
```
