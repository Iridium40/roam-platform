# Unified Booking Architecture Implementation

## üéØ **Mission Accomplished: Unified Booking System**

Building on the success of our unified service architecture, we've now implemented a comprehensive unified booking system that provides consistent booking management across all ROAM applications (Customer, Provider/Business, Admin).

## üèóÔ∏è **What We Built**

### 1. **Unified Booking Type System** (`packages/shared/src/types/bookings/`)

- **`base.ts`**: Core unified booking interfaces and shared types
- **`customer.ts`**: Customer app specific booking views and interactions
- **`provider.ts`**: Provider/business booking management and operations
- **`admin.ts`**: Comprehensive admin booking oversight and analytics
- **`index.ts`**: Consolidated exports with proper type safety

**Key Types Created:**
```typescript
UnifiedBookingBase          // Core booking structure
CustomerBooking            // Customer booking views with reviews/tips
ProviderBooking            // Provider booking management with earnings
AdminBooking               // Admin analytics and investigation tools
BookingQueryOptions        // Unified filtering/pagination
BookingApiResponse<T>      // Consistent API responses
BookingStats               // Analytics across all user types
```

### 2. **Unified Booking API Layer** (`packages/shared/src/api/bookings/`)

- **`UnifiedBookingAPI.ts`**: Complete booking API client with role-specific transforms
- **`index.ts`**: Clean API exports

**Key Features:**
- ‚úÖ **Role-Specific Views**: Customer, Provider, Business, Admin perspectives
- ‚úÖ **Safe JSON Parsing**: Prevents deployment failures with detailed error context
- ‚úÖ **Retry Logic**: Robust network error handling with exponential backoff
- ‚úÖ **Data Transforms**: Handles booking data inconsistencies automatically
- ‚úÖ **Comprehensive CRUD**: Create, read, update, cancel bookings
- ‚úÖ **Advanced Filtering**: Status, date, financial, geographic filters
- ‚úÖ **Booking Validation**: Pre-submission validation with conflict detection
- ‚úÖ **Analytics Integration**: Built-in stats and reporting capabilities

### 3. **React Booking Hooks** (`packages/shared/src/hooks/useUnifiedBookings.ts`)

- `useUnifiedBookingAPI`: API instance management
- `useBookings`: Generic booking fetching with caching
- `useCustomerBookings`: Customer booking history and management

## üöÄ **Booking Data Flow Architecture**

### **Customer Booking Flow**
```typescript
const api = useUnifiedBookingAPI(customerConfig);
const { data: bookings } = useCustomerBookings(api, customerId, {
  bookingStatus: ['upcoming', 'confirmed'],
  includeProvider: true,
  includeService: true,
  sortBy: 'booking_date',
  sortOrder: 'asc'
});

// Customer sees: service details, provider info, timing, pricing, actions
```

### **Provider Booking Flow**
```typescript
const api = useUnifiedBookingAPI(providerConfig);
const { data: bookings } = useProviderBookings(api, providerId, {
  bookingStatus: ['pending', 'confirmed', 'in_progress'],
  includeCustomer: true,
  includeEarnings: true,
  sortBy: 'booking_date'
});

// Provider sees: customer info, earnings breakdown, workflow steps, actions
```

### **Admin Oversight Flow**
```typescript
const api = useUnifiedBookingAPI(adminConfig);
const { data: bookings } = useAdminBookings(api, {
  requires_review_only: true,
  risk_score_range: { min: 50, max: 100 },
  includeAuditTrail: true,
  includeFinancialBreakdown: true
});

// Admin sees: full context, risk analysis, financial breakdown, investigation tools
```

## üîß **Advanced Features Implemented**

### **1. Intelligent Booking Validation**
```typescript
const validation = await api.validateBooking(bookingRequest);
// Checks: availability, conflicts, location, provider capacity, service rules
```

### **2. Smart Fee Calculation**
```typescript
const feeBreakdown = {
  service_amount: 100.00,
  platform_fee: 20.00,        // 20%
  payment_processing_fee: 2.90, // 2.9%
  business_commission: 10.00,   // 10%
  provider_payout: 77.10,      // Remainder after fees
  tip_amount: 15.00,           // Customer tip
  total_platform_revenue: 22.90
};
```

### **3. Risk Scoring and Compliance**
```typescript
const riskAnalysis = {
  risk_score: 25,              // 0-100 scale
  compliance_flags: ['high_value'], // Automated flagging
  requires_review: false,      // Admin review needed
  fraud_indicators: []         // ML-based detection
};
```

### **4. Real-time Calendar Integration**
```typescript
const { calendarData } = useBookingCalendar(bookings, 'week');
// Provides: organized booking views, availability slots, conflict detection
```

### **5. Performance Analytics**
```typescript
const analytics = useBookingAnalytics(bookings, timeRange);
// Provides: completion rates, revenue trends, customer insights
```
